  title: Focus Robots on Education

The TA Swiss (Swiss Technology Assessment Foundation) invited me to praticipate to a focus group about robotics as an expert in robots for education.
I was glad to present an overview of ther research of robotics in education. 
The day ended with a very interesting panl in which many asptects such as ethics, and regulations were discussed.
