 About a year after landing foot in Australia, I have been awarded with a Discovery Early Career Research Award (DECRA) by the Asutralian Research Council (acceptance 16%). 

 The project I proposed is inline with my vision to build co-learning system in which robots can teach novices some skills (see [CoWriter Project](/project/cowriter/)) but also learn from human trainers. 
 To find out more about the project see the page: [HURL](/project/hurl/).
