For the first time ever, the Australasian Joint Conference in Artificial Intelligence had two Women-in-AI chairs. 
Mary-Anne Williams, General Chair of the 2021 edition of the conference contacted me and Prof. Sue Keay to take this new role of Women in AI co-chairs for the conference. 

Since there had never been WAI chairs, the floor was open for us to propose any activities. 
The conference was planned to be help in person and hence we had planned plently of opportunities for our participants to network (Panel Discussion, Networking lunch, training event on inclusion and diversity). 
Unofrtunately the conference moved online. We pivoted by running the Panel discussion online and by having an open lunch discussion with participants. 

We also proposed and wrote a Diversity and Inclusion Policy for AJCAI.
