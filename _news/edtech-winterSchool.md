22 participants attended the 4 days training event at EPFL on Developing Technologies in Educational Settings. 
The winter school recieved the support of the NCCR Robotcs and the Animatas H2020 EU project. 
We had invited great speakers and got excellent feedback from the participants. 
I specially wanted to thank Florence Colomb, Dr. Jennifer Olsen, Prof. Pierre Dillenourg, Dr. Catharine Oertel, Utku Norman, Jauwairia Nasir and Sina Shahmodari for helping me organising the event.
