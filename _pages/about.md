I am a Senior Lecturer at the School of Computing & Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Melbourne.

Previously I was a researcher at the CHILI️ Lab and Mobot Group at EPFL. I hold a PhD in Computer Sciences from the University of Grenoble Alps. My research aims at creating acceptable and useful assistive robot interactions using social signal sensing, affective and cognitive reasonning and natural expressivity. My latest work has investigated the use of tangible robots in education and rehabiliation.
