## Project Description

Robots are envisioned to assist in diverse home and social contexts, such as helping elderly individuals with daily tasks. This project focuses on enabling robots to adapt to their environments by learning context-specific tasks from human trainers, even those without programming expertise.

Inspired by educational theories, the project explores how robots can better learn from novice users while minimizing human workload. Key challenges include:

- Training humans to be effective trainers.
- Reducing user disengagement during repetitive teaching tasks.
- Leveraging gamification and instructional design for improved engagement and learning outcomes.

This three-year project, funded by the Australian Research Council, began in mid-2021.
